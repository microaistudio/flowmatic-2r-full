# Refactoring R1 â€“ Phase I (Stability & Security Foundations)

## Goals
- Transition prototype code into production-ready foundations.
- Introduce consistent tooling, validation, and database safety nets.
- Capture every change in preparation for later phases (UI polish, advanced security).

## Completed Work (Oct 11, 2025)
1. **Async SQLite Client & Transactions**
   - Added `src/database/dbClient.js` exposing promise-based `run/get/all` helpers and `withTransaction`.
   - Replaced manual transaction handling with `withTransaction` to guarantee commit/rollback symmetry.

2. **Kiosk API Refactor**
   - `src/routes/kiosk.js` rewritten to use async/await, centralized validation, and cleaner broadcasting.
   - Validates `serviceId`, `priority`, and optional customer info; rejects malformed requests with 400 errors.
   - Broadcasts and log events only after transactions succeed.

3. **Terminal Flow Refactor**
   - `src/routes/terminal.js` now uses async helpers for `/call-next`, `/complete`, `/transfer`, `/recall`, and `/no-show` with consistent validation and logging.
   - Cherry-pick support restored in `/call-next` (optional `ticketId`) while enforcing agent-service authorization.
4. **Ticket Utility Endpoints**
   - Added `/api/ticket/state` to support front-end cherry-pick workflow and keep queue state in sync (`src/routes/ticket.js`).
   - Implemented `/api/ticket/{requeue,recycle,park,no-show}` so legacy terminal actions update ticket state rather than returning 404.
   - Introduced `/api/counters` for the terminal header to reflect counter/agent activity (`src/routes/counters.js`).
   - Added shared queue snapshot helper to provide deterministic counts for broadcast payloads.
   - Ensures queue updates and socket broadcasts occur after DB commits.

4. **Tooling & Configuration Hygiene**
   - Installed ESLint (v8) + Prettier with project config (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`).
   - Added `npm run lint` and `npm run format` scripts; initial lint run logged legacy issues for future cleanup.
   - Created `.env.example` documenting required environment variables (`PORT`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET`, etc.).

5. **Security Enhancements**
   - Admin auth now validates env vars, hashes passwords with bcrypt, and rate limits login attempts (`src/routes/admin.js`).
   - Settings API guarded by `verifyAdminAuth`.

6. **Process Management**
   - Updated PM2 ecosystem to include `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET` overrides; verified restart flow (`pm2 restart fm-r2f --update-env`, `pm2 save`).

7. **Observability Foundations**
   - Introduced centralized `pino` logger (`src/utils/logger.js`) and wired request logging via `pino-http` (`src/app.js`).
   - Replaced manual `console` calls in server bootstrap, kiosk, terminal, and admin routes with structured logs.
   - Added graceful shutdown handling and consistent error logging in `src/server.js`.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Extend async/await + validation patterns to remaining terminal/admin routes.
- Continue replacing legacy callback-based routes (transfer, recycle, etc.) with the new DB helpers.
- Roll structured logging out to heartbeat/socket utilities and remove remaining `console` usage.
- Implement migration-version tracker leveraging `withTransaction`.
- Define automated test suite (Jest) once critical refactors land.
- Resolve remaining ESLint warnings/errors and enforce CI checks.

## Notes
- All knowledge-base and historical R&D materials moved to `docs/Backup-R & D & Sol  Framework/`.
- Phase II & III documents created as placeholders; populate once respective work begins.
